## Method definition

A method is a function defined and available on an object. A method is a block of code that can receive zero or more arguments, execute and return a value. Most commonly, methods are defined inside classes and modules; they define properties that all instances of the same class share. The code inside a method has access to *instance variables* of the current object.

Unless an explicit `return` statement is used, all methods return the value of their last expression when they run. If the method is defined with a list of arguments, the caller has to pass the required number of arguments when calling the method.
