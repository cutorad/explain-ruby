## "Predicate" method

A method that ends with a question mark (`?`) is otherwise known as a "predicate" method. These methods are like any other methods, but since they look like questions they are commonly implemented so that they return `true` or `false`. This is useful in conditional expressions, e.g. `if size.zero? and file.closed?`.
