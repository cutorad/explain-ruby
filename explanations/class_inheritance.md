## Class inheritance

A class can inherit from another class; this is denoted by the `<` sign. The new class becomes a "subclass" of its parent "superclass" and inherits all methods from the parent class. In the new class, new methods can be added and inherited methods overridden; nothing of this will affect the superclass.
